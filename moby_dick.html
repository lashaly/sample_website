    		<em>Moby-Dick</em></a>
    		by Herman Melville begins with these immortal words:
    	</p>
<p>
	      <span>Call me Ishmael.</span> Some years ago-never mind how long preciesely-having litle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.
</p>    	
        <p>
          After driving off his spleen (Which<em>Can't</em> be good for you),
          iShmael than goes on in much the same vein for approximately one jillion pages. The only thing bigger than Moby Dick (who-<em>spoiler alert!</em>-is a giant white whale) is the book itself.
